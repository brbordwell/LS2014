HPC plan:
- have a prep keyword to figure out ideal values of C and N
    -make sure that when working with N we randomize our selection of values from the data set
    -use all for C

-remove objid in code-->DONE

-make sure we save the choices made (C,N) and the general results of these fits for plotting in the report

-change getdata to select the data used 663748 --->DONE

-use less than Num data points in the function---->DONE
   -make magical list of indices to feed genfromtxt
   	 from itertools import ifilter
	 
	 with open(file) as inp

	      filt = ifilter(lamda x: x[1] > prob and x[2] > prob,inp)
	      genfromtxt(filt)
